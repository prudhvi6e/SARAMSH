# SARAMSH

Saramsh is a simple text summarization package, developed as a part of my major project in Btech (Computer science and engineering) @Vardhaman college of engineering. The package uses TF-IDF scoring mechanism to score the sentences and thus retreiving important sentences (Extractive text summarization).

Our project aims at developing an API which takes a text and generates a summary out of it. The tools that are required for the project are built from scratch to provide flexibility and customizability. And the text summarization is achieved by the extractive text summarization using TF-IDF. Where the summaries are generated by identifying the important sections of the original text and extracting them. By using this API one could summarize huge chunks of text or emails or even a text file.

Getting started :

Installing the necessary requirements. If you are on windows then use cmd, or in ubuntu use terminal. And use the following commands one by one to install the numpy, pandas and nltk libraries.
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install nltk
```

2. Clone the github repository using the command below in cmd or terminal and /saramsh_package is the package directory.
    git clone https://github.com/prudhvi6e/SARAMSH.git

3. Copy the /saramsh_package directory into your project directory.

                    your project directory/
                    ├── saramsh_package/
                    │   ├── init.py
                    │   ├── saramsh.py 
                    └── your_app.py

4. Now import the saramsh using the line below in your application.
```
from saramsh_package.saramsh import Saramsh
```
5. Now create an object for the saramsh class using the line below and pass the data and title as strings in your_app.py file.
```
sm = Saramsh(data , title)
```
6. Now using the object created, call summarize() method. Which will print the threshold value followed by title and summary.
```
sm.summarize()
```

How summarize() method works :

| The current summarize() module uses TF_IDF scoring mechanism to summarize the given raw text data |
| ------ |
| **saramsh.summarize(data, title)** |


| Parameters |
| ------ |
| **data : raw text data** All the pre-processing is taken care by the summarize() itself. |
| **title : raw title of the provided data** Title is currently not used in generating summary. |

| Attributes |
| ------ |
| **tf_ : term frequency** [ndArray] Matrix containing how many times each word repeated in a sentence.And the values are normalized by dividing with length of unique words in each sentence. |
| **idf_ : inverse document frequency** [ndArray] Single row matrix containing idf scores. |
| **tf_idf_ : TF x IDF matrix** [ndArray] Matrix obtained by multiplying tf into idf matrices. |
| **sentenceScores_ : scores of each sentence** [list] Scores of each sentence in the given data. |
| **summary : generated summary** [string] The summary generated using TF-IDF scores. |


| Notes |
| ------ |
| **TF : Term frequency** Term_frequency = (Number of times a term 't' occurs in a sentence) / (Total number of unique words in that sentence) |
| **IDF : Inverse document frequency** Inverse_document_frequency = log((Total number of documents)+1 / (Number of documents in which term 't' appears)+1) |

| Methods |
| ------ |
| Here is a class diagram, containing all the methods within the saramsh package. |

| A typical workflow |
| ------ |
| Below is an workflow of how the module generates summary using the given data. |

Divya Dutta: ‘I once lost a role because I was told I am fair’

She wants to do your role.Earlier, we used to say chhota role nahi karenge.I never said that, but I have seen girls say it.Now they say chhota hai, koi baat nahi, impactful hai na?Divya herself had to colour her skin for Delhi 6.They were looking for a village woman who is darker.They told me you suit the role completely.I asked then why am I not doing it?They replied you are too fair for the role.But I am an actor.I was darkened for Delhi 6.
